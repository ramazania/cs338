h. ARP cache:
    Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
    192.168.112.254          ether   00:50:56:f0:7b:ff   C                     eth0
    192.168.112.2            ether   00:50:56:e9:72:71   C                     eth0

i. To initiate communication with an external host (http://cs338.jeffondich.com), 
    Metasploitable should send the TCP SYN packet to its default gateway 
    with IP address 192.168.112.254 and MAC address 00:50:56:f0:7b:ff, as listed in the ARP cache. 
    The gateway will then handle routing the traffic to the external destination.

j. Yes,  I see an HTTP response on Metasploitable. 
    The wireshark on Kali linux captured 11 packets, which includes:
    TCP handshake and HTTP request.

l. ARP cache:
    Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
    192.168.112.254          ether   00:0c:29:85:d4:8b   C                     eth0
    192.168.112.2            ether   00:50:56:e9:72:71   C                     eth0

    The MAC address is changed to 00:0c:29:85:d4:8b, which means that the traffic goes through Kali.

m. According to the ARP cache it will go to Kali MAC address.

o.  Yes,  I see an HTTP response on Metasploitable. 
    From Kali I can observe all network traffic data between 
    Metasploitable and cs338.jeffondich.com.

p. Basically, the MAC address in Metasploitableâ€™s ARP cache was changed to Kali's MAC Address.
    When Metasploitable sent a request to cs338.jeffondich.com, it would first go to Kali.
    Ettercap does this by manipulating ARP messages, causing devices to mistakenly send their data to the attacker,
    who can then intercept and potentially manipulate the traffic between those devices.

q. I would implement an ARP cache monitoring by continuously observing the ARP cache of my device. 
    This helps in spotting any unusual changes, like having multiple MAC addresses linked to a single IP address. 
    If I notice frequent modifications or new entries in the ARP cache, I'd consider it a potential sign of ARP spoofing.

    In addition, I could also implement machine learning algorithms that can identify unusual patterns or behavior in the 
    network and raise alerts if they deviate from the norm.
