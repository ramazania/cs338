i. To initiate communication with an external host (http://cs338.jeffondich.com), 
    Metasploitable should send the TCP SYN packet to its default gateway 
    with IP address 192.168.112.254 and MAC address 00:50:56:f0:7b:ff, as listed in the ARP cache. 
    The gateway will then handle routing the traffic to the external destination.

j. Yes,  I see an HTTP response on Metasploitable. 
    The wireshark on Kali linux captured 11 packets, which includes:
    TCP handshake and HTTP request.

l. ARP cache:
    Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
    192.168.112.254          ether   00:0c:29:85:d4:8b   C                     eth0
    192.168.112.2            ether   00:50:56:e9:72:71   C                     eth0

    The MAC address is changed to 00:0c:29:85:d4:8b, which means that the traffic goes through Kali.

m. According to the ARP cache it will go to Kali MAC address.

o.  Yes,  I see an HTTP response on Metasploitable. 
    From Kali I can observe all network traffic data between 
    Metasploitable and cs338.jeffondich.com.

p. Basically, the MAC address in Metasploitableâ€™s ARP cache was changed to Kali's MAC Address.
    When Metasploitable sent a request to cs338.jeffondich.com, it would first go to Kali.
    Ettercap does this by manipulating ARP messages, causing devices to mistakenly send their data to the attacker,
    who can then intercept and potentially manipulate the traffic between those devices.

q. I would implement an ARP cache monitoring by continuously observing the ARP cache of my device. 
    This helps in spotting any unusual changes, like having multiple MAC addresses linked to a single IP address. 
    If I notice frequent modifications or new entries in the ARP cache, I'd consider it a potential sign of ARP spoofing.

    In addition, I could also implement machine learning algorithms that can identify unusual patterns or behavior in the 
    network and raise alerts if they deviate from the norm.


--------------Synthesis----------------

a.  Mal's strategy for intercepting the traffic between Alice and Bob revolves around exploiting the vulnerability of ARP cache poisoning.
    This technique involves Mal sending forged ARP messages to Alice and Bob's devices, tricking them into associating Mal's MAC address with
    their respective IP addresses. As a result, when Alice wants to communicate with Bob, her device is misled into sending the traffic to Mal's computer instead.
    This allows Mal to intercept, analyze, and potentially manipulate the data passing between Alice and Bob, all without their knowledge. ARP cache poisoning is
    a known security issue that underscores the importance of network security measures to detect and prevent such attacks, as it can lead to unauthorized access to
    sensitive information and potentially malicious actions.

b.  From Alice's perspective, ARP cache poisoning attacks are difficult to detect because they happen silently, without any visible signs or warnings.
    To detect such attacks, Alice could use intrusion detection systems, ARP spoofing detection software, secure network configurations, and periodically
    check her device's ARP cache for unusual entries. These measures can help her identify and mitigate the risk of ARP poisoning attacks.

c.  Same as Alice's perspective. 

d.  While HTTPS significantly enhances security and makes it much more difficult for attackers to manipulate data in transit, it's important to note that ARP cache poisoning
    attacks can still potentially occur and lead to the interception of encrypted traffic. However, the attacker would not be able to decipher the encrypted content, 
    and the browser would likely display warnings to Alice and Bob, which might prompt them to investigate further. For additional protection, network security measures should still
    be implemented to detect and prevent ARP cache poisoning attacks.
