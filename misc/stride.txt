List of Threats and Mitigations (STRIDE):

Spoofing (S):
1. Threat: Attacker spoofing a user to gain unauthorized access.
    - Mitigation: Implement strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
2. Threat: An attacker impersonating the Linode web server.
    - Mitigation: Use SSL/TLS certificates for Linode web server authentication.

Tampering (T):
1. Threat: Data tampering during transmission between the web client and Linode server.
    - Mitigation: Implement data integrity checks, like digital signatures, and use HTTPS.
2. Threat: Unauthorized modification of user data in the database.
    - Mitigation: Apply proper access controls and database integrity constraints.

Repudiation (R):
1. Threat: Users denying their actions on the Tapirs Unlimited platform.
    - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive audit logging and ensure users cannot modify their logs.

Information Disclosure (I):
1. Threat: Exposure of user data in transit, e.g., chat logs or personal information.
    - Mitigation: Encrypt data transmission with HTTPS, restrict access to sensitive data.
2. Threat: Leaked user data from the database server.
    - Mitigation: Regularly update database security, apply encryption, and access controls.

Denial of Service (D):
1. Threat: DDoS attacks on the Linode web server causing unavailability.
    - Mitigation: Use anti-DDoS services, load balancing, and rate limiting.
2. Threat: Service interruption due to an issue with the home office network.
    - Mitigation: Implement redundancy and monitoring for the home network.

Elevation of Privilege (E):
1. Threat: Unauthorized escalation of privileges in the mobile apps.
    - Mitigation: Apply the principle of least privilege and regular code audits.
2. Threat: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Linode server to gain unauthorized access.
    - Mitigation: Regularly update server software, apply security patches, and use intrusion detection systems.

Other:
1. Threat: Social engineering attacks on users to reveal sensitive information.
    - Mitigation: Educate users about security awareness and reporting procedures.
2. Threat: Insider threats from employees having access to user data.
    - Mitigation: Implement strict access controls, employee training, and regular security reviews.
